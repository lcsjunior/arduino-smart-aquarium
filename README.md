# arduino-smart-aquarium

This ESP32 T-Relay device is intended to monitor and control my two planted nano aquariums. It uses the ds18b20 sensor to measure the water temperature, has a thermostat function and also has an on/off schedule for lights and CO2 solenoid valve.

For this project, I chose to use the ThingSpeak IoT platform. See the dashboard here: <https://thingspeak.com/channels/2421172>
